# CytoAutoCluster: A Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Framework for Cytometry Data Analysis

## Overview
CytoAutoCluster is an advanced deep learning framework designed for cytometry data analysis. It combines semi-supervised learning, autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction, and clustering techniques to overcome challenges like high dimensionality, noisy data, and missing labels. This project also provides an interactive Gradio-based user interface for visualizing and exploring clustering results.

## Features
- **Preprocessing**: Handles data cleaning, feature imputation, and normalization.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Employs PCA and t-SNE for effective data visualization.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Trains an autoencoder to handle incomplete data and extract robust latent features.
- **Clustering**: Uses k-Means and Hierarchical Clustering with evaluation metrics like ARI and Silhouette Score.
- **Gradio Interface**: Offers real-time interaction for visualizing clustering results and adjusting parameters.
