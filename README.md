4. **Provide Insights**: Generate clear and interpretable visualizations of cell groupings.
5. **Ensure Scalability**: Build a framework that can handle large-scale datasets without performance loss.

## Features Breakdown

### Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces dimensionality while retaining variance for better visualization and clustering.
- **t-SNE**: Uses non-linear dimensionality reduction to preserve local structure in the data.

### Semi-Supervised Learning Techniques
- **Consistency Regularization**: Helps improve the stability of the model with input perturbations.
- **Entropy Minimization**: Encourages more confident predictions for unlabeled data.
- **Masking Techniques**: Focuses the modelâ€™s learning capacity on the most relevant portions of the data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Clean and preprocess high-dimensional cytometry data.
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) using histograms, boxplots, and correlation matrices.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Apply PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction to visualize the data better.

3. **Semi-Supervised Learning**:
   - Implement consistency regularization and entropy minimization to leverage unlabeled data.
   - Design a self-supervised function to extract features for improved clustering.

4. **Model Training**:
   - Train a series of baseline models, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost.
   - Develop a semi-supervised deep learning model to boost clustering performance.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate interpretable visualizations of the clusters.

## Technical Overview

### Core Techniques
- **Skewness & Kurtosis Analysis**: To evaluate data distribution and detect outliers.
- **Corruption and Masking**: Introduce noise into the data to make the model more robust.
- **Cluster Validation**: Metrics like Silhouette Score, Purity Score, and Adjusted Rand Index are used for validating clustering results.

### Tools & Frameworks
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For visualizing data and clustering results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For dimensionality reduction and classification models.
- **XGBoost**: For gradient boosting models.
